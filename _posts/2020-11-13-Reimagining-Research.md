# An Overview of the Base Study
The study i looked at covered different urban cities  
and the way they managed to deal with increasing  
water scarcity. With an increase and population  
there is an inherent increase in water usage, yet  
many of the cities covered in the study managed to  
actually cut down on water usage, which managed to  
split the link between the population and water usage.

# The Experiment
### 1. Identify a statistical question that you could ask.
Which one of the methods offered in the study remains the most  
successful?  
Since the study offered plenty of different methods of cutting water  
usage, we canbranch off and find which one of those methods proved  
to be the most efficient.


### 2. Identify the population you would study to answer the question. What information about the population would help answer your question?
The population would be all of the states since every state uses water.  
A more reasonable population could be California as it is labled as one  
of the states with the highest amounts of water consumption. For this,  
we would need to keep track of how much water is being used during the  
set time period as well as what method is being used by who.


### 3. Identify a feasible sample frame, and explain your reasoning.
A reasonable sample frame could be Los Angeles since it is the  
most populated city in California, which would cause more water usage  
on a daily basis.
### 4. Identify the sampling method you would use, and explain your reasoning. What makes this method better than the others?
Voluntary sampling and interval sampling are two good methods to  
use for this experiment. We canâ€™t force the within the sample frame  
to be part of the experiment, it has to be voluntary. Interval sampling  
is used so that there are not just clumps of people, but an even spread.

### 5. Suppose you had the means to run an experiment on this sample. Identify the null and alternative hypotheses.
The null hypothesis would be that both of the methods work equally  
as well as the other, while the alternative hypothesis would declare  
one method as better than the other.


### 6. Identify the variables and treatments that would provide information about your question. Explain your choice of treatments.
Have an algorithm randomly generate two lists from the people selected,  
one being for one method of conservation and the other being for a different  
one. This is done because we are not trying to gauge individual effectiveness,  
but comparing methods to see which one is better

### 7. Identify the treatment groups, and how each subject would be assigned to a group.
As mentioned before, these people can be put into randomly generated lists.  

### 8. Briefly discuss how the experiment would be conducted.
Over a given period of time, monitor how much water the people are using  
in a residential setting. This can be a month, or a whole year, but it  
needs to be long enough to be able to generate comparable results.


### 9. What biases may come up, and how would you address them?
Coverage bias is a very big issue in this experiment. California  
is not very representative of many other states in the country  
for many reasons. The easiest way to combat this bias would  
be to simply expand the sample frame, even though on the larger  
scale that is quite hard. Since no one sample frame will be  
sufficiently representative of the population except if the  
frame is the population itself, expanding is the only way to  
reach that representation.
