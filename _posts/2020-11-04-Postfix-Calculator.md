# My Take on A Postfix Calcultor

## The Total Average of The Dataset
The ending average of the dataset wound up being 529.91.  
I did this by making two different variables, one where I would  
add 1 for everyone and then another where I just keep adding the  
number that evaluate(row) produces. This would give me the total  
sum of all the results and I just divided it by the number of rows.
