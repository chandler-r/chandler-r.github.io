# The Correlation Between Video Games and Psychological Functioning

## Reviewing The Data

In 2019, 4 German Psychologists released a reaearch article in which  
they displayed their research which tried to make an association between  
psychological functioning. psychological functioning itself is the ability  
to achieve one's own goals, whether they be internal or external. By studying  
many different variables within the test subjects and referring towards  
the gaming in the same way, they were able to establish the relationships  
which they wanted to examine. The spread of induviduals leaned towards younger  
males as they were found to be the most likely to be playing video games.  
The different points of information taken by having the participant answer about  
how they were feeling based on different scales that were created. These consist  
of things such as coping strategies, shyness, and loneliness, to name a few. 

## The Results and Conclusions 

### Problematic Game Use and Psychological Functioning
In the end there were a few different conclusions that were made using the data  
found. These conclusions all made correlations between potentially problematic  
video gaming and these previously mentioned functions.n The first correlation that  
was made was between the different functioning variables and the problematic use  
of video games. People who presented this problematic use of video games seemed  
to be more towards the lonely side, having lower self esteem and fewer real life  
connections, which resulted in more online connections with people who presented similar behaviors.

### Reasons For Game Use and Its Correlation with Psychological Functioning
The researchers found many different reasons why people would develop these  
problematic habits, but the most prevalent one was using games as an escape  
from stress. Many of these people who presented these tendencies tended to use  
negative coping strategies like substance abuse or self-blame. Some of the people  
use games as a way to have something to talk to people about or in an attempt  
to better some real-life skill. This results in increased online connections  
and a generally more positive effect on these people. These are results I found to  
be the least surprising since I have definitely used games in all of these ways  
in different times in life. They definitely do serve as a good way to excel your  
communication skills as well as a good distraction when things may be going bad.

### Game Genre and Psychological Functioning
The genre spread provided an interesting result. Action games were mostly in line with  
people who had decreased academic performance while role-playing games were preferred more  
by those who were higher on the shyness/loneliness scale. This is a result that makes  
sense as action games usually take some strategy and time and practice,  
while role-playing games allow you to go into a completely different  
world with a bunch of different characters, allowing you to escpae the real world.

## "Publish or Perish": How Truthful is this Study
In the case of this study, I don't think this studywas forced out in order to  
make money. This is because this study does not exactly benefit either side  
which it is researching since the relations were not fully clear and this is  
an ongoing effort to figure out what exactly the correlation is. There were  
limitations that were acknowledged within the study. They pointed out that  
the people who were picked overrepresented the potentially problematic gamers.  
Also, rather than taking the data themselves, they allowed the people who were  
being tested to report it themselves. Yet again, this was only a small step in  
this realm of study. There are more future steps to be taken in order to get a  
more full scope and grasp of the situation.
