## My past with CS
I have always enjoyed computer science and engineering since i was a kid.  
Things like video games and how they worked always fascinated me which is  
why I started taking CS courses at school. As of right now, Ive taken an  
introductory level CS course as well as done some work on my own time.  
Being that Math is one of my favorite subjects and it has quite a lot to do  
with CS, I'm currently taking a PCAB class and plan on  
taking a statistics class next year.
