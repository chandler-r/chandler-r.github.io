## My past with CS
I have always enjoyed computer science and engineering since i was a kid.  
Things like video games and how they worked always fascinated me which is  
why I started taking CS courses at school. As of right now, Ive taken an  
introductory level CS course as well as done some work on my own time.  
Being that Math is one of my favorite subjects and it has quite a lot to do  
with CS, I'm currently taking a PCAB class and plan on  
taking a statistics class next year.

## Favorite Hobby
Origami has always been a thing that i enjoyed ever since i first found out  
what it was. What really attracted me to it was the way that small pieces of  
folded paer could be put together to make something so beautiful. This  
type of origami is called modular origami, and like the name its based on  
putting together small modules into something big. Me being very interested  
in engineering definitely has a lot to do with why I gravitate to it. Here  
is an example of what modular origami might look like.![modular origmai][Origami]

## What I'm Looking Forward To
This year im most looking forward to data visualization. Data is usually  
always presented in some sort of chart or table and it has always been  
very boring to look at. I hope to learn new and more interesting ways to  
present data rather than just spitting numbers and stats back to the reader.  
If data were presented in a more eye catching way and a simpler way,  
I think it would be more helpful
